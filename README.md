# A* Path Finding Algorithm for 2D Grid World
## AIM
To develop a code to find the route from the source to the destination point using A* algorithm for 2D grid world.

## THEORY
A* works by making a lowest-cost path tree from the start node to the target node using heuristic function.A* search is a combination of lowest-cost-first and best-first searches that considers both path cost and heuristic information in its selection of which path to expand.A* uses a function f (n)= g(n)+h(n) that gives an estimate of the total cost of a path using that node.

## DESIGN STEPS

### STEP 1:
Import the required packages.

### STEP 2:
Create a class with the appropriate functions.

### STEP 3:
Build a 2D grid world with initial state , goal state and obstacles.

### STEP 4:
Define a method for heuristic function.

### STEP 5:
Pass the values for the grid problem.

### STEP 6:
Print the solution.

## SOLUTION JUSTIFICATION:
A* combines the advantages of Best-first Search and Uniform Cost Search: ensure to find the optimized path while increasing the algorithm efficiency using heuristics.Complexity in A* Search is that the Algorithm doesnâ€™t produce the shortest path always, as it relies heavily on heuristics / approximations to calculate h.

## RESULT:
Hence, A* Search Algorithm was implemented for path finding from the source to the destination point in 2D grid world.
